            <h3 id="informational-videoconference">Informational Videoconference</h3>
            <p>If you’re interested in seeking office, we will host a group video conference on Thursday, January 18th from 6-8 PM. You may join and leave whenever you like.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this call is to provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of current board members, clarify any unclear or ambiguous portions of this elections document, meet other potential candidates, and gain the confidence to run.</p>
            <p>The call will be hosted on Google Hangouts Meet at <a href="meet.google.com/vis-cdsw-dsm">meet.google.com/vis-cdsw-dsm</a>. As the number of simultaneous participants is limited to 25, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrjKFR64jjwJgT1A">please RSVP</a> so we can anticipate turnout and host a second session if necessary.</p>
            <h3 id="candidate-statements-2">Candidate Statements</h3>
            <p>When you <a href="https://airtable.com/shrBpyvtS14dBuAM8">declare your intent to run for office</a>, you may submit a candidate bio, tagline, statement and headshot for inclusion on this page and in our other elections resources.</p>
            <p>Three newsletters will be sent to the caucus membership in the campaign period as described below. As we have nine offices up for election and anticipate some competitive races, including the entirety of every candidate’s statement in each email newsletter is impractical. The newsletters will contain only a breakdown of candidates by race, each candidate’s name, and their tagline. The candidate’s name will be linked to their statement on this page.</p>
            <p>Taglines may not exceed fifteen words.</p>
            <p>The bio/statement should be no longer than 200 words.</p>
            <p>You may elect to include a headshot with your statement, they will appear together on this page. For stylistic consistency, this should be a color portrait photo without any text or other manipulation superimposed.</p>
            <p>No materials may contain links or URLs.</p>
            <p>Revisions may be sent to Ben Isserlis at <a href="mailto:secretary.controller@cydprogressives.org">secretary.controller@cydprogressives.org</a>. Online materials will only be updated as frequently as new declarations, that is, once per week on Wednesdays.</p>
            <h3 id="questions-from-members">Questions from Members</h3>
            <p>In lieu of a debate (which would be costly, time consuming, interminably long, difficult to plan, and near impossible to coordinate between all candidates for all offices), we will begin accepting questions from members when the first campaign newsletter is sent out on January 24th.</p>
            <p>Members will have until February 7th to submit questions for any particular office or for all candidates. We will then sort the questions and distribute the set to all candidates. Candidates will have until February 13th to submit their responses.</p>
            <p>Responses will be accepted in the form of a PDF and linked from the candidate’s statement and in the second newsletter. Candidates may choose one question &amp; answer pair to “feature”, which will be included directly in this page adjacent to their statement. The featured answer should be no longer than 200 words, or an excerpt may be designated. The featured answer may not include any links or URLs.</p>
            <p>Though there is no restriction on the length of the provided PDF, candidates are advised to keep it succinct. We’re not here to read your novel and if you submit any fragment of War and Peace in jest we’ll make you wear a silly hat during the election.</p>
            <p>Revisions will not be accepted once answers are posted.</p>
            <h3 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h3>
            <p>We will distribute three newsletters during the campaign period from January 24th to February 21st.</p>
            <p>Each newsletter will contain a list of all elections, all eligible candidates for each election, those candidates’ taglines, and a link to the candidate’s statement on this page.</p>
            <p>The first newsletter will be sent on January 24th. In addition to the list of candidates, it will include a request for members to submit questions for candidates as described above.</p>
            <p>The second newsletter will be sent on February 14th. In addition to the list of candidates, it will include the candidates’ responses to the member questions collected previously.</p>
            <p>The third newsletter will be sent on February 21st and will mark the close of the campaign period at midnight. No further names will be collected for inclusion on the ballot or on this page, though members are of course allowed to be nominated from the floor and written in.</p>
            <h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>

            <p>Any registered member of the caucus present at the annual meeting at the California Young Democrats Convention in San Diego February 23-25 is eligible to vote in the caucus elections.</p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg action-button" href="https://airtable.com/shr6iJ7BVkl1wEJmL">Register for Membership</a>
            <p>If you have never registered or updated your registration online with us, please do so now! Our online registration form is much more comprehensive than any paper form or spreadsheet you may have filled out, and is the primary way to get involved with one of our caucuses as well.</p>
            <p>Registration and attendance will be checked at the door. Only registered members may cast a ballot.</p>
            <p>During the meeting, nominations will be opened and all verified candidates will be nominated en masse. Further nominations from the floor will be accepted.</p>
            <p>Once nominations are closed, the Secretary will read the list of candidates in the order in which they must deliver their speech.  Speeches will be ordered first by office, then alphabetically by last name. Candidates should form a line at the front of the room in the order in which they are to speak so that the process may move along promptly. As we anticipate having many candidates for our many offices, candidates should not expect to receive more than one minute for their speech.</p>
            <p>Out of respect for all candidates, ballots will be distributed fifteen minutes from the end of the meeting or at the end of speeches, whichever comes first.</p>
            <p>All expediency will be made in tallying the vote, however members should not be surprised to find the final determination announced by email some hours after the meeting has adjourned.</p>
            <h3 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h3>
            <p>Seeing that the meeting runs smoothly and completes within a reasonable time takes coordinated effort on the part of many people. Thank you for your interest, and thank you for your help.</p>
            <p>Volunteers are needed to</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Register new members</li>
              <li>Verify registrations and check all attendees in</li>
              <li>Usher people to seats and maintain decorum</li>
              <li>Distribute ballots</li>
              <li>Count ballots</li>

            <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg action-button" href="https://airtable.com/shrlXju84RNALwCX5">Volunteer at Convention</a>
            <p>Volunteers must be available for 2 hours in the week before convention for training, and for 2-3 hours during convention for the meeting (setup, the program, cleanup).</p>
            <p>More information will be posted as materials are finalized and dates set. Volunteers will be contacted with dates for videoconference training sessions in early February.</p>
